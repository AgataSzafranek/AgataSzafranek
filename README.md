ABOUT ME

I have recently embarked on a personal journey to pursue a career as a software tester, a goal that has been on my mind for quite some time. 
Throughout my professional experience, I have utilized various platforms to assess the suitability of a career as a software tester, and these experiences have only reinforced my belief 
that this is the right path for me. I have acquired a diverse set of skills that are highly applicable to the role.
Notably, I have acquired a keen attention to detail, particularly in the exploration of new software and understanding its functionality.
